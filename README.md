# Open Delivery Mock

This repository implements a simple Mock Server using Docker and [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/) for the [Open Delivery API](https://abrasel-nacional.github.io/docs/).

## Running

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, so, in your terminal just run `docker-compose up -d`. Optionally, you can run `docker-compose logs -f` to follow that is happening on the Mock Server.
